TRISURF NG
==========


1. Instalation
--------------

To compile the program, user must have ``automake``, and ``gcc`` tools installed on the computer.

Required C libraries are:
* libconfuse
* libgsl
* libxml2
* zlib

and python libraries for running tsmgr:
* tabulate
* psutil
* configobj

On Debian based systems, install prerequisities by typing the following command in the command line:

``sudo apt-get install libconfuse-dev libgsl0-dev libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev automake gcc python3-psutil python3 python3-pip pkgconf libtool``
``sudo pip3 install tabulate configobj``

Move to the project root directory and compile with:

``./configure``

``make``

``make install``

If you are experiencing difficulties due to different automake versions, proceed with the longer procedure:

``aclocal``

``autoheader``

``automake -ac``

``autoconf``

``autoreconf -if``

``./configure``

``make``

``make install``


This procedure can be done automatically by calling the build.sh script.

2. Use
------

Prepare tape file, storing the definition for the simulation. You can use the sample tape file in the ``src/`` directory as a template for your simulation.

Run simulations with ``trisurf-ng --force-from-tape`` for initial run, or ``trisurf-ng`` for continuing aborted simulations.
